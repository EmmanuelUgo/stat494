I learn languages for the fun of it. At the moment, I am an active Spanish speaker and an active German learner. I also love to work with data, create visualizations, models, reports, shiny web applications and recently started writing to improve my storytelling capabilities.\r\nSoon, I will be diving into building APIs and learning web scraping, SQL and a lot more. I am an active learner, I am very positive that i can achieve that. Currently, I started a course STAT494: Advanced Data Science in R by Lisa Lendway. I really love the syllabus and i am looking forward to completing the course. Thanks for visiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
